Exercises:

After altering the code as requested in the exercises the example of where the system did not work well is the syntax of the sentence. Originally i took out the "to" of "I want to". Then when I ran the magpie code the first two letters of the string that the code took from my input were not showing. To fix this i changed the addition of 9 down to an additon of 7.
